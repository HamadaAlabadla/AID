Gaza Aid Network

## FOR

The target group consists of displaced families in the southern Gaza Strip, including families who have lost their homes due to political and economic circumstances. In addition to this group, the program will also be directed towards humanitarian organizations, local associations, and governmental entities that provide support and assistance to these displaced individuals.

## WHO
The need for a program to register displaced families has grown due to the continuous increase in their numbers and the challenging conditions they endure. The program aims to :

- Document family data comprehensively and accurately to facilitate the provision of food, health, and shelter assistance.
- Prioritize needs according to each familyâ€™s circumstances, enabling more effective allocation of limited resources to those in need.
- Establish an up-to-date database accessible by organizations to coordinate efforts and prevent duplication of support.

## THAT

The main benefit of this program is to provide a unified and reliable platform that helps organize personal data and information about displaced families, making it easier for relevant entities to direct support in a coordinated and timely manner. It also facilitates communication with displaced families and enables updating their information over time.
